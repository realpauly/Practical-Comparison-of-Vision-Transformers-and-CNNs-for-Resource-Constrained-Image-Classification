# Abstract

Deep learning has significantly advanced image classification tasks, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet-18 dominating the field for decades. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture global context. However, their computational complexity and reliance on large-scale datasets raise questions about their efficiency and practicality in resource-constrained environments.

This project investigates the comparative performance of ResNet-18 and Vision Transformers on the CIFAR-10 dataset under limited computational and data resources. Both models were evaluated based on accuracy, efficiency, and resource usage. ResNet-18 exhibited strong performance, achieving 90.37% accuracy with rapid convergence and efficient resource utilization. In contrast, ViT struggled to generalize, achieving only 27.9% accuracy due to its lack of inductive biases and dependency on larger datasets for pretraining.

The findings highlight ResNet-18’s suitability for resource-constrained settings and small datasets, while emphasizing ViT’s strengths in scalability for large-scale tasks. This study underscores the need for tailored architectural choices based on data availability and computational constraints and provides actionable recommendations for improving ViT’s performance through advanced training techniques and pretraining strategies.

# 1. Introduction

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. Most
studies on ViTs have explored their performance on large-scale datasets
requiring significant computational resources. This project aimed to compare the
practical implementation of Vision Transformers with one of the widely used CNN
models, ResNet-18, under resource-constrained conditions. The investigation was
inspired by the work of Dosovitskiy et al. (2021), which introduced a
transformer-based approach for image recognition, showcasing that a non-CNN
architecture could achieve competitive performance by treating image patches as
sequences.

The focus of this project was on the application of ViTs and CNNs to the
CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used benchmark for image classification. The
comparison considered two key aspects: efficiency and accuracy. By analyzing
their performance in resource-limited environments, the study provided insights
into the practicality of these models in real-world applications where
computational and data resources are limited.

# 2. Background of the Study

Deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision, with
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dominating image classification tasks for
over a decade. CNNs, through their hierarchical architecture, extract features
from images by convolving input data with learnable filters. This approach
enables CNNs to capture both low-level and high-level image features, making
them highly effective for tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and
classification. However, despite their success, CNNs face limitations in
capturing global context and handling long-range dependencies, which are crucial
for certain image analysis tasks (Maurício et al., 2023).

Inspired by the remarkable success of transformers in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), Vision Transformers (ViTs) were introduced as an alternative
architecture for image classification. Unlike CNNs, which rely on local feature
extraction, ViTs utilize a self-attention mechanism to model relationships
across the entire image. By dividing images into patches and treating them as
sequences, ViTs excel at capturing global dependencies and contextual
relationships. However, their high computational complexity and reliance on
large datasets pose challenges in resource-constrained environments (Maurício et
al., 2023).

With the emergence of ViTs as a promising alternative to CNNs, it has become
crucial to understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of these
architectures under varying conditions. Studies have shown that while ViTs
outperform CNNs in tasks requiring global context, they may struggle with
generalization when trained on smaller datasets. Conversely, CNNs demonstrate
superior performance on limited data due to their spatial inductive biases and
established training methodologies. These contrasting characteristics highlight
the need for comparative studies to identify optimal use cases for each
architecture (Maurício et al., 2023).

# 3. Tools and Algorithm Description

## 3.1 Vision Transformers (ViTs)

Vision Transformers (ViTs) are a novel deep learning architecture inspired by
the success of transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Unlike
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ViTs split an image into fixed-size
patches, flatten each patch, and project them into a higher-dimensional space.
These patches are then processed as sequences, similar to words in NLP tasks,
using the self-attention mechanism. This architecture allows ViTs to model
long-range dependencies across an entire image, making them well-suited for
tasks requiring global context.

The architecture of ViTs consists of three main components:

1.  **Patch Embedding**: The image is divided into fixed-size patches, and each
    patch is linearly projected into an embedding vector. Positional embeddings
    are added to retain spatial information.

2.  **Transformer Encoder**: A series of transformer encoder layers applies
    self-attention and feed-forward operations to capture relationships between
    image patches.

3.  **Classification Head**: A learnable `[CLS]` token is appended to the
    sequence, and its final representation is used for classification tasks
    through a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head.

![Figure 1: Example of the architecture of ViTs (Source: Maurício et al.,
2023)](VIT.png)

This process is illustrated in Figure 1, showing how ViTs process images as
sequences of patches, enabling a global understanding of visual information.

## 3.2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models that
have been the backbone of computer vision tasks for over a decade. CNNs utilize
convolutional layers to extract spatial features from images by applying
learnable filters. These filters capture local patterns, such as edges and
textures, and hierarchically build up to more abstract features in deeper
layers.

The core components of CNNs include:

1.  **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters to input images to extract local
    spatial features.

2.  **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps, typically
    using max-pooling or average-pooling, to make computations efficient and
    capture essential patterns.

3.  **Fully Connected Layers**: After flattening the feature maps, fully
    connected layers are used to combine the extracted features and perform
    classification tasks.

![Figure 2: Example of the architecture of CNNs (Source:Maurício et al.,
2023)](CNN.png)

This hierarchical approach allows CNNs to capture fine-grained details in images
while maintaining computational efficiency. Figure 2 illustrates a typical CNN
pipeline, highlighting the convolutional layers, pooling operations, and fully
connected layers for classification.

## 3.3 Comparison Between ViTs and CNNs

While CNNs rely on local receptive fields and weight sharing to process images,
ViTs use self-attention mechanisms to model global relationships. CNNs are
highly efficient on smaller datasets due to their inductive biases but may
struggle with capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, ViTs excel in
capturing global context but require large datasets and significant
computational resources for training.

Figures 1 and 2 provide a visual representation of the architectures of Vision
Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks, respectively.

## 3.4 Implemented Models

This study implemented two models:

-   **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**: The ViT architecture introduced by
    Dosovitskiy et al. was implemented. ViTs treated image patches as sequential
    data and used self-attention mechanisms for feature extraction. While ViTs
    are designed to perform well on large-scale data, this project explored
    their behavior on smaller datasets like CIFAR-10.
-   **ResNet-18**: A widely used CNN model, ResNet-18 introduced skip
    connections to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. It served as a
    benchmark for image classification tasks due to its balance between
    complexity and performance.

Both models were implemented using PyTorch. Libraries such as Hugging Face and
torchvision were utilized for data preprocessing and augmentation. The
implementation ensured consistent evaluation metrics and training conditions for
both models.

# 4. Experiment Design

## 4.1 Dataset and Preprocessing

The **CIFAR-10 dataset** was divided into training (50,000 images) and testing
(10,000 images) sets. Since the Vision Transformer requires fixed-size 224x224
image inputs, the images were resized during preprocessing. Data preprocessing
included:

1.  **Resizing**

All images were resized to 224x224 pixels for compatibility with ViTs and to
maintain consistency across models.

2.  **Normalization**

The images were normalized to have a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.5
to stabilize the training process.

3.  **Augmentation**

Techniques such as random cropping and flipping were applied to enhance model
generalization.

The **torchvision.transforms** module was used for these preprocessing steps.
Data was loaded into memory using the PyTorch **DataLoader** with optimizations
such as `pin_memory` for faster data transfer to the GPU.

## 4.2 Model Architectures

Two models were implemented:

1.  **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**: - Utilized the `vit_base_patch16_224` model
    from the `timm` library. - Modified the classification head to output
    predictions for 10 classes. - Pre-trained weights were leveraged to
    initialize the model for faster convergence.

2.  **ResNet-18**: A convolutional neural network with residual connections to
    enable deeper network training. The fully connected layer was replaced with
    a layer tailored for 10-class output. Here, Pre-trained weights were used
    for initialization.

These models represent two contrasting deep learning paradigms. ViTs excel at
modeling global relationships in images, while ResNet-18 relies on local feature
extraction through convolutions.

## 4.3 Training Procedure

The training process was designed to ensure fairness and efficiency:

1.  **Hyperparameters**: - Batch size: 32 (chosen to accommodate GPU memory
    constraints). - Learning rate: 0.001 (used for both models). - Number of
    epochs: 10.

2.  **Loss Function**: - Cross-entropy loss was used for classification tasks.

3.  **Optimization**: - The Adam optimizer was employed for its ability to adapt
    learning rates.

4.  **Mixed Precision Training**: - Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) was enabled
    using `torch.cuda.amp` to reduce memory usage and speed up computations.

5.  **Device**: - Models were trained on a GPU when available, falling back to a
    CPU otherwise.

During training, GPU memory utilization was logged to monitor resource usage.

## 4.4 Evaluation Procedure

After training, the models were evaluated on the CIFAR-10 test set using the
following metrics:

1.  **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified images.

2.  **Loss**: The average cross-entropy loss on the test dataset.

3.  **Resource Utilization**: Memory consumption and computational time were
    logged during both training and evaluation.

## 4.5 Modifications to Data

To adapt the CIFAR-10 dataset for both architectures:

1.  Images were resized to 224x224 to meet the input requirements of the Vision
    Transformer.

2.  Data augmentation, such as random cropping and flipping, was applied to
    increase variability and reduce overfitting.

## 4.6 Visualization

Training progress was visualized through:

1.  **Accuracy per Epoch**: A line plot showing the improvement in model
    accuracy over training epochs.

2.  **Loss per Epoch**: A line plot depicting the reduction in loss for both
    ViTs and ResNet-18.

These plots provided insights into the convergence behavior and performance
trends of the two architectures.

# 5. Results

In this section, the performance results for Vision Transformer (ViT) and
ResNet-18 are shown using the following metrics: **Accuracy**, **Efficiency**,
and **Resource Usage and Speed**. The results are derived from training on the
CIFAR-10 dataset and are supported by graphical visualizations.

## **5.1 Vision Transformer (ViT)**

1.  **Training Loss**:

    -   ViT exhibited a minimal reduction in training loss, starting at
        **2.0522** in epoch 1 and ending at **1.9462** in epoch 10.

    -   The slow convergence highlights the model's difficulty in optimizing for
        the CIFAR-10 dataset.

![Figure 3: ViT Training Loss](vit_training_loss.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  **Validation Loss**:

    -   Validation loss remained nearly stagnant, fluctuating between **1.9178**
        and **2.0064** . This indicates that ViT struggled to generalize, likely
        due to the lack of inductive biases suited for small datasets.

![Figure 4: ViT Validation Loss](vit_validation_loss.png){fig-align="center"}

3.  **Accuracy**:

    -   ViT achieved an accuracy range of **23.22%–27.90%** over the training
        epochs, with a slight improvement in later epochs (Figure 5). However,
        the accuracy trend remained flat, indicating limited learning capacity
        for CIFAR-10.

![Figure 5: ViT Accuracy](vit_accuracy.png){fig-align="center"}

4.  **Epoch Time**:

    -   ViT required significantly longer training times, ranging from **2047.64
        seconds** in epoch 2 to **3004.18 seconds** in epoch 7 (Figure 6). This
        reflects the high computational cost of ViT’s self-attention mechanism.

![Figure 6: ViT Epoch Time](vit_epoch_time.png){fig-align="center"}

5.  **Efficiency**:

    -   Despite underwhelming performance, ViT maintained a consistent memory
        allocation of **2743.08 MB** and memory reservation of **8640.00 MB**
        throughout the training process.

## **5.2 ResNet-18**

1.  **Training Loss**:

    -   ResNet-18 demonstrated rapid and consistent convergence, with training
        loss decreasing from **0.7020** in epoch 1 to **0.0625** in epoch 10
        (Figure 7). This highlights the efficiency of ResNet-18's convolutional
        architecture in extracting meaningful features.

![Figure 7: ResNet-18 Training
Loss](resnet_training_loss.png){fig-align="center"}

2.  **Validation Loss**:

Loss](resnet_validation_loss.png){fig-align="center"}

3.  **Accuracy**:

    -   ResNet-18 achieved high accuracy, starting at **80.43%** in epoch 1 and
        stabilizing around **90.06%–90.37%** from epoch 7 onward (Figure 9). The
        rapid rise in accuracy reflects the model's ability to learn efficiently
        from CIFAR-10.

![Figure 9: ResNet-18 Accuracy](resnet_accuracy.png){fig-align="center"}

4.  **Epoch Time**:

    -   ResNet-18 exhibited lower training times than ViT, with epoch durations
        ranging from **2047.64 seconds** to **2432.47 seconds** (Figure 10). The
        shorter training times reflect the computational efficiency of
        ResNet-18's convolutional operations.

![Figure 10: ResNet-18 Epoch Time](resnet_epoch_time.png){fig-align="center"}

5.  **Efficiency**:

    -   ResNet-18 required the same memory allocation as ViT (**2743.08 MB**)
        and reserved memory (**8640.00 MB**), highlighting comparable GPU
        resource demands.

# **6. Discussion**

## **6.1 Model Accuracy**

Upon compariosn, it can be observed that ResNet-18 outperformed ViT
significantly in accuracy, reaching near-optimal performance on CIFAR-10 with an
accuracy of **90.37%** by epoch 9, compared to ViT’s best accuracy of
**27.90%**. ResNet-18’s convolutional architecture, with its inherent inductive
biases for spatial locality and hierarchical feature extraction, was well-suited
to a small-scale dataset like CIFAR-10. Conversely, ViT, which relies on global
self-attention and benefits from pretraining on large-scale datasets, struggled
to generalize in this setting. The nearly flat accuracy curve of ViT further
underscores its inability to effectively learn from the limited dataset.

![Figure 11: Accuracy Comparison Between ViT and
ResNet-18](accuracy_per_epoch.png){fig-align="center"}

## **6.2 Training and Validation Loss**

The **training loss plot** (Figure 12 & 13) reveal that ResNet-18 consistently
reduced its training loss across epochs, converging effectively. Validation loss
followed a similar trend, demonstrating alignment with training loss, which
suggests that ResNet-18 generalized well to unseen data. In contrast, ViT’s
training and validation losses stagnated at high values (\~1.95-2.0), reflecting
poor optimization and limited capacity to extract meaningful features from the
dataset.

![Figure 12: Training Loss Comparison Between ViT and
ResNet-18](training_loss_per_epoch.png){fig-align="center"}

![Figure 13:Validation Loss Comparison Between ViT and
ResNet-18](validation_loss_per_epoch.png){fig-align="center"}

## **6.3 Resource Usage and Speed**

The **Epoch Time per Epoch** plot (Figure 14) highlights the training time
trends for both models, showing that their epoch durations were largely similar.
Training times ranged from approximately **2040 seconds** to **3004 seconds**,
with a peak at **epoch 7**. Both models exhibited variability in training times,
with some epochs taking longer to train than others.

Despite using similar GPU memory during training (**2743.08 MB allocated and
8640.00 MB reserved**), the training times reflect the computational demands of
the models. The variability may be attributed to fluctuations in data loading or
specific operations during certain epochs. While ResNet-18 typically benefits
from efficient convolutional operations, this dataset's complexity or
implementation details may have led to its epoch times being comparable to ViT,
which employs resource-intensive self-attention mechanisms.

![Figure 14: Epoch Time Comparison Between ViT and
ResNet-18](epoch_time_per_epoch.png){fig-align="center"}

## **6.4 Performance Implications**

The graphs provide clear evidence of ResNet-18’s superiority across all metrics:

-   **Accuracy**: ResNet-18 consistently delivered significantly higher
    accuracy, supported by its ability to reduce both training and validation
    losses.

-   **Efficiency**: Both models utilized similar GPU resources, but ResNet-18
    required less computational time to achieve convergence.

-   **Suitability**: ViT’s subpar performance highlights its dependency on large
    datasets and pretraining, making it unsuitable for small-scale datasets like
    CIFAR-10 in resource-constrained environments.

## **6.5 Why Vision Transformers (ViT) Performed Poorly**

1.  **Lack of Inductive Biases**

-   CNNs like ResNet-18 leverage biases such as **spatial locality** and
    **translational invariance** to capture local patterns effectively.
-   ViTs, which rely on attention mechanisms and treat images as sequences of
    patches, lack these inductive biases.
-   **Impact**: ViTs struggle to generalize on smaller datasets like CIFAR-10,
    resulting in stagnation in accuracy and loss reduction.

2.  **Dependence on Large-Scale Data**

-   ViTs are designed for large datasets like ImageNet-21k or JFT-300M, while
    CIFAR-10 (50,000 training images) is relatively small.
-   **Impact**: Insufficient data prevents ViT from learning robust
    representations, leading to slower learning and poor optimization.

3.  **Model Complexity**

-   ViTs have higher parameter counts and quadratic complexity in their
    self-attention mechanisms, making them computationally demanding.
-   **Impact**: Prone to overfitting and inefficiencies in small datasets or
    resource-constrained environments.

4.  **Limited Regularization**

-   CNNs benefit from inherent regularization due to structured kernels and
    pooling layers.
-   ViTs require external regularization methods such as dropout or advanced
    data augmentation, which were not extensively applied here.
-   **Impact**: Lack of aggressive regularization contributed to ViT's
    stagnation in training performance.

5.  **Training Dynamics**

-   ViTs often need advanced learning rate schedules (e.g., warm-up or cosine
    annealing) for effective training.
-   **Impact**: Suboptimal training schedules hindered ViT's ability to converge
    effectively.

## **6.6 Observations on ResNet-18**

**Strengths**

1.  **Local Feature Extraction**:
    -   Convolutional layers efficiently capture patterns (e.g., edges,
        textures), which are essential for CIFAR-10.
2.  **Efficiency**:
    -   Achieves high accuracy with low computational demands, making it ideal
        for resource-constrained environments.
3.  **Regularization**:
    -   Built-in inductive biases and pooling mechanisms naturally prevent
        overfitting.

**Weaknesses**

-   Limited versatility for unstructured datasets where global attention
    mechanisms (e.g., ViTs) might be advantageous.

## **6.7 Observations on Vision Transformers (ViT)**

**Strengths**

1.  **Scalable Architecture**:
    -   Designed for large-scale datasets, ViTs excel in tasks requiring global
        context and long-range dependencies.
2.  **Versatility**:
    -   When pretrained on large datasets, ViTs achieve state-of-the-art
        performance in image classification tasks.

**Weaknesses**

1.  **Data Dependency**:
    -   Require extensive pretraining on large datasets to perform well. Without
        inductive biases, ViTs struggle to extract meaningful features from
        small datasets like CIFAR-10.
2.  **Overparameterization**:
    -   ViTs have a high parameter count, making them prone to overfitting on
        small datasets and inefficient in resource-constrained settings.

#### **6.8 Recommendations for Future Work**

1.  **Pretraining**:
    -   Fine-tune a **pretrained ViT model** (e.g., pretrained on ImageNet) to
        leverage learned representations.
2.  **Data Augmentation**:
    -   Use advanced techniques like **CutMix**, **Mixup**, or **RandAugment**
        to increase dataset size and diversity.
3.  **Regularization**:
    -   Introduce stronger regularization methods, such as dropout or label
        smoothing, to reduce overfitting.
4.  **Learning Rate Optimization**:
    -   Employ advanced learning rate schedules, such as warm-up or cosine
        annealing, to improve training dynamics.
5.  **Alternative Architectures**:
    -   Explore lightweight transformer variants like **MobileViT** or **DeiT**
        for smaller datasets and lower-resource environments.

# **7. Conclusion**

This study compared the performance of Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet-18 on
the CIFAR-10 dataset, focusing on metrics such as accuracy, efficiency, resource
usage, and training dynamics. The results highlight a stark contrast between the
two models in terms of their suitability for small-scale datasets.

ResNet-18 outperformed ViT across all performance metrics, achieving a
near-optimal accuracy of **90.37%**, rapid convergence in training and
validation losses, and computational efficiency with relatively stable epoch
times. These strengths are attributed to ResNet-18's convolutional architecture,
which effectively leverages inductive biases such as spatial locality and
hierarchical feature extraction, making it well-suited for smaller datasets like
CIFAR-10. ResNet-18’s ability to generalize effectively demonstrates the
robustness of its design in resource-constrained environments.

In contrast, ViT struggled to learn from the limited data, with accuracy
stagnating at **27.90%** and both training and validation losses remaining high
throughout the training process. The lack of inductive biases, dependency on
large-scale pretraining, and computationally expensive self-attention mechanism
rendered ViT less effective in this setting. Furthermore, the limited
regularization and training optimizations applied in this study hindered ViT's
performance, emphasizing the model's dependency on advanced configurations and
larger datasets to unlock its full potential.

The resource usage analysis revealed that both models utilized similar GPU
memory; however, ResNet-18 demonstrated higher computational efficiency by
maintaining shorter epoch durations compared to ViT. This efficiency underscores
the practical advantages of convolutional networks in environments where
computational resources and dataset sizes are limited.

## **7.1 Key Findings**

-   **ResNet-18**:

    -   High accuracy and rapid convergence.

    -   Effective generalization and computational efficiency.

    -   Suitable for resource-constrained environments and small datasets.

-   **ViT**:

    -   Poor performance on CIFAR-10 due to a lack of inductive biases.

    -   Dependency on large-scale data and advanced training optimizations.

    -   Higher computational demand with limited benefits on smaller datasets.

## **7.2 Implications**

This study reaffirms the effectiveness of convolutional architectures like
ResNet-18 for small-scale datasets. While ViTs offer state-of-the-art
performance on large datasets with extensive pretraining, their adoption for
smaller datasets and resource-constrained settings requires additional
techniques such as pretraining, data augmentation, and advanced regularization
methods.

## **7.3 Future Directions**

1.  **Pretraining**: Fine-tuning ViTs pretrained on larger datasets (e.g.,
    ImageNet) may bridge the performance gap observed in this study.

2.  **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like CutMix, Mixup, or RandAugment can
    help overcome data limitations for ViT.

3.  **Optimized Architectures**: Exploring lightweight transformer variants,
    such as MobileViT or DeiT, could improve the applicability of ViTs for small
    datasets.

4.  **Learning Rate Schedules**: Implementing advanced schedules, including
    warm-up and cosine annealing, can enhance ViT’s training efficiency.

In conclusion, while ResNet-18 is well-suited for small-scale datasets like
CIFAR-10, Vision Transformers require significant adaptations and additional
resources to achieve comparable performance. Future research can address these
limitations by leveraging transfer learning, enhanced regularization techniques,
and tailored architectural adjustments to unlock the full potential of
transformer-based models in constrained environments.
